      Player born in the arenas of Unreal Tournament back in 1999, I went
      through all the chapters of the saga: UT, UT2k3, UT2k4, UT3 and the new
      UT.


      Quake in the various editions, Tribes, Painkiller, Warsow, Toxikk, Reflex,
      in short, everything that gravitates around the FPS arena.


      This passion led me to create the FlakYou portal, a site dedicated to the
      world of FPS Arena


      From 2001 to the present with my historical clan The Hit Squad we
      dedicated ourselves to the most "tactical" games like Medal Of Honor and
      the various editions of COD.
